Introduction
------------

This Map is designed to help users to Find the Right Place for their home.
Several public datasets containing factors for the attractiveness of 
urban spaces were combined to generate one simple to use map indicating
the neighborhood of the highest comfort for each individual.

In the "Layers" tab, single layers can be viewed. Please note that even
though it is possible to activate multiple layers, they are not combined 
but overlay each other. The features of each layer are selected using 
reasonable filters in order to portray only those features affected by 
the selected parameter. Generally, the darker the display color, the 
stronger is the feature influenced by the specified parameter, negatively
(e.g. in case of noise pollution) or positively (e.g. in case of 
distance to nature). 

In the "Usecases" tab, different use cases have been pre-calculated. They 
all are named for a better designation and contain different parameters.

Julia
-----
Julia is a young university student with a dog. She needs to be close to 
nature for her dog to feel comfortable. Since she regularly travels, she 
would also like to be close to public transport without having to suffer 
from any noise pollution. Therefore the parameters used are nature and 
public transport as positive and noise pollution as a negative factor.

Peter
-----
Peter loves to party and enjoy nights out with friends. He studies at
the local university but strongly dislikes getting up early. Noise 
doesn't bother him too much though. The parameters used in the Peter
usecase are density or restaurants and nightlife as well as a close
distance to university. 

Anna & Klaus
------------
Anna and Klaus are a middle-aged couple and both work full-time. They 
like arts and theater and often spend the evening with a good meal in
a restaurant and a stage play or concert afterwards. But because 
Anna works for an international company, she needs to be close to 
public transport as well. For Anna and Klaus, the culture and 
restaurants parameter as well as the public transport were combined.

Fam. Schiller
-------------
The Schiller family consists of Mum and Dad with their two teenage 
daughters. The daughters love shopping in their free time but mum 
and dad rather enjoy some peaceful quietness. Also, the mum has a 
strong pollen allergy and wants to live far from any trees. This 
layer is a combination of shopping as positive and nosie as well 
as nature as negative factors.
